    <ul class="image-display">
        <li class="charts"><p><img class="chart-item" src="img/bubble_and_pie_chart.png" alt="A bubble and pie chart">
            The data types shown in the bubble and pie chart are both attributes and positions. Attributes refers to the different "slices" of pie chart. Their color would classify as a categorical attribute, while their area is a quantitative attribute. Lastly, the positon of the pies/bubbles is also a datum since it's relevant to the information being communicated. For the marks and channels of this visual, we identified two marks: points for the "bubble" aspect of the visual, and area for the "pie" aspect of the visual. For the channels, we saw three possible channel types in the visual: One, the different colors or categories of the pie chart, Two, the position of the pies/bubbles on the X and Y axis, and 3, the area of a pie/bubble on the X and Y axis. This differs from the area mark, as the mark refers to the area of each category inside each pie/bubble, while the channel refers to the whole area of a pie/bubble, especially in relativity to the other data points.

    </li>
        <li class="charts"><p><img class="chart-item" src="img/bump_chart.png" alt="A bump chart"> The data types we identified in the bump chart are categorical and sequential attributes. Categorical refers to the different categories displayed in the bump chart, while sequential refers to the linear progression of time (2005-2015) and how the rankings change within that timeline. In terms of marks and channels, we idenfitied one mark, the points and lines of each category, while the channels are the colors of each category and the position of each category throughout the timeframe, relative to rank. 
        </p></li>
        <li class="charts"><p><img class="chart-item" src="img/mind_map.png" alt="A mind map"> The data types we identified in the mind map visual are categorical attributes and links. The categorical attributes differentiate between "theme", "category", and "idea", while the links are the connections between all three of these categories, which can be interpreted as meaningful. For marks and channels, we idenfitied two marks, points and lines. The points refer to the oblong ovals that represent the theme, ideas, and category, while the lines connect all these entities together. For channels, we concluded the two relevant channels would be categorical, which differentiates between an idea and a category, and position. Although position might not be the first channel that comes to mind, it is relevant, especially since major concepts are connected directly through the theme, while other ideas branch out from those, meaning that the proximity to the central theme matters.

        <li class="charts"><p><img class="chart-item" src="img/stacked_bar_chart.png" alt="A stacked bar chart"> The data types we identified with this visual are sequential and categorical attributes.Categorical refers to the different categories (colors) within each group, and the different group (A B C D ). For the marks and channels, we identified both area and lines in the visual, lines referring to the lines that make up each group/rectangle, and area referring to the different areas of each category within the groups. Lastly, for channels, we concluded that vertical height (position) and color are the channels present in this visual. The vertical heights of the different groups communicate the differences in magnitude between the different groups, while color demonstrates how the different categories affect the total magnitude.
